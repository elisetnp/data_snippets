# Code Snippets

The primary aim of this repository is to store and share reusable code snippets that can simplify various processes, solve common problems, and serve as a reference for future projects. Whether you are a beginner seeking examples or an experienced data analyst or data engineer in need of quick solutions, I hope you find something useful here.

Still a work in progress, as we all are.

✨ to my amazing work buddies who have been a constant source of inspiration and support ✨
